## Free limitations

As this is a project I am doing for fun with no revenue, there is no budget for it.  
And as running backend services and hosting applications usually has costs associated with it,
there are limits imposed on this project.

Specifically, I went with a Firebase backend for the project (there is no tracking, i.e. I am not using
any analytics services - only database, hosting, etc.). The free limits can be found on the [Firebase pricing] page.  
The project does run on a Blaze Plan, so there might be costs associated for me, however, it is only reasonable for
me to stay within the free limits that you can find on the left side of the table on that site.

### Breakdown

Here is a table of relevant limits that directly limit the GitHub tracker application.
