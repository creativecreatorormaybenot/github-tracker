# github-tracker [![GitHub Tracker on Twitter][github tracker twitter shield]][github tracker twitter] [![creativecreatorormaybenot on Twitter][creativemaybeno twitter shield]][creativemaybeno twitter]

Tracking the top 100 GitHub software repos.

## Contributing

Any contributions to this project are more than welcome! If you want to help, feel free to give it a shot :)

The easiest way for you to make contributions is opening issues or preferrably if similar issues already
exist, upvote them and/or join the discussion. You can find existing issues and open new issues in the
[issues tab of this repo][github tracker issues].

If you feel like there is any information missing for you to make a contribution in the form of a pull
request, please feel free to create an issue for that as well. I guess I will have to figure out what
contributing information (as in documentation) is required to make PRs on such a project.

## Costs

Because of costs for backend services required to operate GitHub Tracker, I am **draining money** with this
project, which is fine as I enjoy doing it.

Essentially, I need to pay GCP bills every month.  
This **limits** how much/often I can process data for GitHub Tracker etc. as I cannot burn an unlimited
amount of money for this project - although I am willing to burn quite a bit because I _like_ the project (:

I am not sure what to do about this yet. [Let me know][dm] if you have any ideas :)
